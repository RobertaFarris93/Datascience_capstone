## Overview
This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.  
It demonstrates the application of **Python, SQL, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning** to solve a real-world problem.

## Data
- **Source:** SpaceX open data 
- **Features:** Launch site, booster version, payload mass, orbit, customer, success/failure  
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling  


## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration & Visualization** – Identify trends in launch outcomes  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Prepare dataset for ML models  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create meaningful variables for prediction  
4. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Plotly  
- **SQL:** For data extraction and aggregation  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive analysis and visualization  

## Results
- Key findings on factors affecting launch success  
- Performance metrics of predictive models  
- Visualizations showing trends by launch site, booster, and payload
